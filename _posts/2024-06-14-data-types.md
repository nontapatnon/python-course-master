### What is a Data Type?
In programming, a data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold. It defines the operations that can be performed on the data and the way the data is stored in memory. Python is **dynamically** typed, which means that you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable; the interpreter infers it at runtime.

### Mutable vs. Immutable Objects
In simple words, the value assigned to a variable cannot be changed for the immutable data types. **For example**, String is an immutable data type in Python. We cannot change its content, otherwise, we may fall into a **TypeError**. Even if we assign any new content to immutable objects, then a new object is created (instead of the original being modified).
